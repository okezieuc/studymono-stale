2020 was a very different year. The pandemic brought various challenges to the academic system. Many students were not able to get access to education because they couldn't attend classes at school. Some luckier students had to attend online classes which many believe are not as effective as in-person classes.

Some of the challenges that came with the pandemic brought about effects that rolled over to the 2020/2021 academic session. The most notable of these effects is the unusual scheduling of the secondary school leaving examinationsâ€”WAEC and JAMB. It turns out that most of these examinations are not holding in the usual periods that they were held in previous years.

## When will 2021 WAEC be Written

WAEC has traditionally been held in months May and  June of every year. In 2020, the exam could not be conducted in these same months and ended up being conducted in **August 2020**. This year's schedule for WAEC is very similar to last year's. The body stated  that WAEC 2021 is scheduled to start on 16th August 2021 and end on 30th September 2021. They made this announcement on their Twitter handle and various other media.

 The timetable for the examination has not yet been published at the time of writing. We will update you when the timetable is released.

## When will 2021 JAMB be conducted

The period when JAMB will be written will also be different from previous years. JAMB has traditionally been administered in the middle of March. This year, because not all schools did the first term at the ending of 2020, the body decided to shift the examination to a later part of the year. The exam is scheduled to hold between 19th June 2021 and 3rd July 2021. Registration for JAMB CBT 2021 ends on the 29th of May 2021.

## Making the Best out of this Years Exams

You are to take very good advantage of the shift of the examination dates. WAEC and JAMB being held further away than usual is an excellent opportunity for students who had not been very serious with their academics to sit up and try to get back on their feet. This is like a second chance for such students to get prepared for the examinations. As for the students that have always been serious with their academics, the shift in exam date is also an advantage as they can become even better than they were. However, this shift can also be a disadvantage for them. This is because when such a student loses focus, they may end up forgetting what they had previously known.

## What should I do to Prepare for JAMB and WAEC in 2021

Our advice to the SS3 students that are planning to write WAEC and JAMB this year is to remain focused on their work. The students who have always been taking their work seriously are to continue with their attitude and make use of this opportunity to get better. The others are to view this shift in date as a second chance to perform better in these examinations.
