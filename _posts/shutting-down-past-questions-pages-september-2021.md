Studymono has provided hundreds of students across Nigeria—and beyond—with easy access to detailed explanations to questions that previously appeared on the WAEC and JAMB exams. This was made possible by lists on our website that showed students questions from a subject of their choice and well documented pages that showed the questions, the answers, and the reason behind the answers.

Today, however, we decided to shut down the public question pages on our website. These pages will no longer be available, but will redirect back to our homepage. This will allow our team more time to work on a revolutionary educational platform we're building. At the end of this month, we will be announcing our newsletter where you can catch up with our work at Studymono.

See you on the platform!
